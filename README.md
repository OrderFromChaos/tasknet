### Technical details

This program uses [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)), so it runs in terminal (blazing fast) and completely without external dependencies.

The program is technically laid out using a browser-esque url system, where pages can request a new URL to be loaded as they close. As a result, adding new functionality simply requires writing up a class for that page.

The program may be run by calling "python -m main".
